## Website Style Guide
Developers and designers use design systems in order to organize the look and feel of a website or web application. Design systems help to document the visual vocabulary and reusable components of a large website.

## Objective
In this project, I practiced building a simple style guide/design system for my website covering aspects such as CSS box model, display and positioning, colors, and typography.
